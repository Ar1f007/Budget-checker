# Money Master Assignment

It was the 5th of total 12 assignments provided by Programming Hero team to me in our early days of learning Javascript.

The task was to create a budget checker application using JS where user can put their total income amount, along with the outcome, for example food expense, rent expense etc. Then show the user how much they have spend, and incase they can save some amount or not.

One of the main tasks was to show error on different event (if it occurs) and warn user about it.
